# A Sustainability Hackathon with Founders & Coders

## Overview
While providing the industry's leading training in full-stack JavaScript, Founders & Coders looks to support social enterprise and community projects. Organisations that we are already scheduling collaborations with include the Anna Freud Centre, Zing Foundation, Year Here, On Purpose, CAST, and New Philanthropy Capital. Passionate about sustainability, we're looking to work with organisations involved at every level of the sustainable development chain.

## Why hackathons?
They provide exceptional value to sustainability organisations wanting to:
* explore digital services
* train staff in managing digital projects
* engage with service users
* produce working, testable web apps
* improve data structure and storage
* automate outdated processes
* start a pipeline of digital products

## Advanced preparation
* Ideas are solicited from the organisation about what problems they want to solve.
* A number of related themes are chosen for the hackathon.
* Optionally, around 5-7 different projects are decided in advance.
